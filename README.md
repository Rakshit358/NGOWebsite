# Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a common text classification task where the goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, often as either positive or negative. This project explores the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms—Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classification, and Logistic Regression—on this task.

  

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of labeled text data where each entry is associated with either a positive or negative sentiment label. You can use datasets like the IMDb movie reviews, Amazon product reviews, or Twitter sentiment datasets.  

## Model Overview

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a variation of the Naive Bayes classifier that works well with binary/boolean features. It's particularly effective for tasks where the presence or absence of a feature is more informative than the frequency of the feature.

### Support Vector Classification (SVC)

Support Vector Classification is a powerful and versatile classifier, capable of performing linear and non-linear classification. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective linear model for binary classification. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class, making it a popular choice for many classification tasks.

### Results
The performance of each model can be evaluated using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results/ directory contains detailed reports and visualizations comparing the performance of the three algorithms.
